## Introduction
This repository is a collection of daily challenges, problems, and solutions I solve as part of my ongoing journey to master DSA. The problems are solved using Java, and each solution is optimized for readability and efficiency.

## Why Practice DSA?
Data Structures and Algorithms are the backbone of computer science. Mastering them is crucial for:
- **Problem Solving**: Developing a strong foundation in problem-solving techniques.
- **Competitive Programming**: Excelling in coding competitions and technical interviews.
- **Efficiency**: Writing code that is both time and space efficient.

## Topics Covered
This repository covers a wide range of DSA topics, including but not limited to:
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Sorting and Searching
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Bit Manipulation
- Hashing

## Structure of the Repository
The repository is organized into folders based on different DSA topics. Each folder contains:
- **Problem Statement**: A brief description of the problem.
- **Solution**: The Java code implementing the solution.
- **Explanation**: A detailed explanation of the approach and logic used.
